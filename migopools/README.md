# Pools

* Existing pools
* A pool created by you

Creating your own pool is usually done by new projects looking to debut their cryptocurrency token. If that doesn't sound like you, providing liquidity to an existing pool is the better option. Once you select the pair you're providing liquidity for, go ahead and deposit by confirming the transaction. After depositing, you'll receive `MIGO_LP`, an LP token that represents your stake in the pool.&#x20;

The benefit of holding the `MIGO_LP` token is every time an exchange happens that taps into your pool's liquidity, you receive a portion of the rewards. To claim those rewards, you simply redeem your `MIGO_LP` tokens to unlock the underlying assets which, by now, have grown in value.
