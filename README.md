### Concept Introduction

Decentralized finance has changed the Narratives in both the universe and crypto-verse. Though introduced in a while back, It’s not just a trend, it’s the future of finance and cryptocurrency. Decentralized finance is becoming the greatest innovation of the century, a technology set up with the primary aim of liberating mankind from the shackles of governments and financial institutions. DeFi – and by extension, Blockchain technology – not only offers a better alternative to traditional financial institutions and local currencies, but also an exposure to global markets at one’s fingertips.
