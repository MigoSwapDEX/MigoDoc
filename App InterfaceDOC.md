## App Interface

Our App interface consists of the following contracts.
- Swap
- Liquidity Pool
- Yield Farming Pool
- Milkbar Pool

***Swap***

Our Swap interface let users swap CORE crypto-assets. You can Instantly swap crypto tokens: no registration or account needed.

_To trade, click on the App button, then select the token to be swapped and the desired token then click on swap!
 The trading fee is 0.03%., some percentage goes to liquidity providers, and some goes to MigoSwap Treasury which is used for MIGO buyback and burn._

***Liquidity Pool***

This pool let users, project owners, investors stake their crypto-assets to earn profit.
The staked assets are used on the swap interface for trading. To encourage liquidity pool creators/providers we offer a plethora of DeFi farming opportunities.... 
Those who provide liquidity to our pool gets LP tokens and earn a portion of trading fees. Liquidity provider tokens are called _MIGO_LP or simply LP tokens.

You can also Stake LP tokens to earn MIGO or Other tokens. (A percentage of our trading fees goes to liquidity providers).

_*How To Use?*_

Click Liquidity, then Add liquidity, and make sure your wallet is unlocked. Now you'll be asked to specify which tokens you're providing liquidity for. Remember, providing liquidity on MigoSwap is done in pairs, meaning you must provide two tokens.
You can provide liquidity to either:

- Existing pools

- A pool created by you

Creating your own pool is usually done by new projects looking to debut their cryptocurrency token. If that doesn't sound like you, providing liquidity to an existing pool is the better option.
Once you select the pair you're providing liquidity for, go ahead and deposit by confirming the transaction. After depositing, you'll receive MIGO_LP, an LP token that represents your stake in the pool.
The benefit of holding the MIGO_LP token is every time an exchange happens that taps into your pool's liquidity, you receive a portion of the rewards.
To claim those rewards, you simply redeem your MIGO_LP tokens to unlock the underlying assets which, by now, have grown in value.

***Staking and Yield Farming***

MigoSwap intensifies yield farming for liquidity providers to earn rewards in high APR! Our farm is an incentive for liquidity providers.

To farm, simply deposit your given LP tokens to mint our partners' tokens available  on our platform or MIGO token.
In Our Yield Farm, your MIGO_LP token which is a representative of the Liquidity you provided can be staked to earn other 
tokens depending on the yield farm of your choice..

**APR for Yield Farming Pools**

High APR - Liquidity Pool for MIGO Pair.

High APR - Liquidity Pool for other token pairs.

The APR decreases as the liquidity providers increase ( This values are subject to change when we go live)

_*How To Use?*_

To use, choose the farms with higher APR that interest you most, then use your LP tokens to stake.
