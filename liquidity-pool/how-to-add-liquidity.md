# How To Add Liquidity?

Liquidity is an essential part of MigoSwap feature! When you add liquidity you get 0.018% of the Trading fee.

To provide liquidity, you’ll need to commit an amount of any token pair you like. Your lowest value (in USD) of the two tokens will be the limit to the liquidity you can provide.

In this example, we will add liquidity using CORE and MIGO

1. Visit the Liquidity page.
2. Click the Add Liquidity button.
3. For the top Input, click 'select a currency' and pick CORE.
4. For the bottom input, click ‘Select a currency’ and pick MIGO.
5. Enter an amount on one of the tokens under “Input”. The other will calculate automatically.

(If your balance is too low on one pair enter a lower amount.)

6. Click the Approve MIGO button. Your wallet will ask you to confirm the action.
7. The Supply button will light up. Click it.
8. A window will appear saying how much you will receive. Click the Confirm Supply button. Your wallet will ask you to confirm the action.
9. After a short wait you will see your LP Token balance at the bottom of the page.

You can repeat the steps above to add more liquidity at any time
